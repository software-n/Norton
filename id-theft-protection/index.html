If you have never experienced it you may be forgiven for thinking it could never happen to you. You would be wrong.</p><p>The FTC reports that 1/3 of all US citizens have already experienced identity theft at least once in their life. Identity theft accounted for $56 billion of stolen money in 2020 alone. That’s <i> billion</i> with a b.</p><p>Of that number, $13 billion was lost to large-scale data hacks; the type you see making front-page news when a company has to take to the stand with tales tucked between legs and apologize for ‘compromising’ the sensitive information of their customers.</p><p>Perhaps even more staggering, the remaining $43 billion was lost to direct-interaction scams. You know those emails you used to (and maybe still do receive) about a billionaire uncle you never heard of who just happens to need a couple of thousand dollars to help him out of a sticky situation? Those are called phishing emails and they have matured in recent years. So much so that even tech-savvy millennials are increasingly falling victim to them - millennials now constitute 35% of all fraud cases.</p><p>The threat of Identity theft is criminally underestimated and misunderstood and until we take sensible protection measures, these types of statistics will continue to grow. Just in case you were in any doubt, here are some more shocking statistics:</p><ul class="leftbullet"><li>One in ten US adults fall victim to scams every year</li><li>1/5 of EU citizens have experienced identity fraud</li><li>Over one million children are victims of identity theft each year</li><li>Identity theft claims a new victim every 14 seconds in the US</li><li>The average loss for an individual is $3500</li><li>Thieves also use stolen identities to mask real-world criminal activities</li></ul></div><div class="hl-box hl-box-purple mt-5"><h3><strong>An overview of the best ID Theft Protection Software for 2025:</strong></h3><ul class="leftbullet"><li><strong>&#129351; 1. <a href="https://aurainc.sjv.io/c/2996736/1084627/12398?subId1=lugchga49z21il2kyzpgw" title="Aura" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Aura</a> — </strong><strong>Rated 4.5 stars in TrustPilot, Aura is an advanced ID theft protection program designed to give your entire family a safe and carefree internet experience.</strong> </li><li><strong>&#129352; 2. <a href="https://idshield.pxf.io/c/2996736/1566491/18219?subId1=lugchga49z21il2kyzpgw" title="IDShield" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IDShield</a> — </strong>IDShield protects your identity, credit, and online privacy from fraud.

Even with a protection service, it is still necessary to use sensible internet practices such as never sharing your passwords, never providing sensitive data unless you are 100% sure of the authenticity of the receiver, and trusting the adage - ‘if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.’</p><p>That being said, even with the best will in the world it is not always possible to avoid identity theft on your own. Every time you apply for credit, a new job or home, sign up for a subscription service, or make a purchase online you are entrusting that company with your valuable data. Couple that with online scams that are increasingly so sophisticated that they are almost indistinguishable from reputable companies and those staggering scam statistics start to make sense.</p><p>An identity theft protection service may not be able to 100% protect you but what it can do is:</p><ul class="leftbullet"><li><strong> Insure you against any losses incurred.</strong> Should the worst happen, you can breathe easy knowing it won’t put a dent in your finances. Many services offer comprehensive coverage of personal financial losses up to $1 million.</li><li><strong>Rebuild your credit.</strong> You may think losing your hard-earned cash would be the worst of it. However, the long-term ramifications can be life-altering. Identity theft can seriously damage your credit, making it impossible to apply for everything from a mortgage to a credit card. An identity theft protection service will guide you through the process of rebuilding your credit so that you can get back to living.</li><li><strong>Stop a breach in its tracks.</strong> Identity theft protection services scour the internet and dark web for any evidence of your personal data existing where it shouldn’t. By informing you of a potential breach you can act first to cancel cards and change passwords before the thieves have a chance.</li><li><strong>Provide you with a private investigator.</strong> These are professionals who will look into your individual case, investigate the origin of the breach, and offer advice to prevent it from ever happening again.</li> <li><strong>Offer 24/7 support and peace of mind.</strong> Unsure whether that email you received is <i>really</i> from your bank? No problem! Expert advisors are on hand at any time to support you. Avoid catastrophe with a friendly expert to help you traverse the world wide web.</li></ul><p>Now what kind of coverage you require will vary dependent on your needs. However, here are our three favorite identity theft protection services for 2025:</p></div><div class="mt-5"><strong></strong></div><h2 id="review-1" class="mt-5">1. <a class="h6-title" href="https://aurainc.sjv.io/c/2996736/1084627/12398?subId1=lugchga49z21il2kyzpgw" title="Aura" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Aura</a> — Best For Families</h2><p><a href="https://aurainc.sjv.io/c/2996736/1084627/12398?subId1=lugchga49z21il2kyzpgw" title="Aura" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid" src="../media/855/article-aura.png" alt="aura"></a></p><div><p>Aura offers an <strong>all-in-one solution</strong> to help you protect your family from identity theft.
