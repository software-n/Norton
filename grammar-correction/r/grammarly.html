It is a reliable and efficient tool to help improve your writing quality and accuracy. As a freelance writer, editor, and content publisher, I rely on Grammarly Premium to proofread my work daily. It corrects every spelling and grammatical error while improving my style, flow, tone, and word choice. I also use it to double-check articles written by other freelancers I collaborate with. It also helps that it integrates with all of the other apps and programs I use; it just makes everything easier. In this Grammarly review, I'll give you some background on the product before diving into its main features. I'll also go over how to get the most out of Grammarly and whether or not you should pay for the Premium version.</div><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-md-6 mt-4"><b class="pl-2 pr-2">&#128077; PROS:</b><ul class="list-unstyled ticks-pros ticks-good p-0"><li>Correct grammar in real-time</li><li></li><li>Featured in over half a million mobile, web, and desktop applications</li><li></li><li>Easy integration into your life</li><li></li><li>Trusted by over 30 million users and 50,000 teams</li><li></li><li>Highly precise and superior to other grammar checkers</li><li></li><li>With the tone detector enabled, your true writing tone will be revealed, stripped of any unnecessary flourishes</li><li></li><li>Over four hundred different features and checks, including those for grammar, spelling, punctuation, plagiarism, and more.</li><li></li><li>Great spell checker</li><li></li><li>Fantastic online thesaurus</li><li></li><li>Grammarly appears to understand context and vocabulary better than alternatives</li><li></li><li>Enterprise-grade privacy and security</li><li></li><li>Well-designed UI</li><li></li><li>Customizable – select preferred language, block certain websites, add new words, etc. </li><li></li><li>The corrections are explained in an understandable manner</li><li></li><li>Discounts available for bulk buyers and educational institutions</li></ul></div><div class="col-12 col-md-6 mt-4"><b class="pl-2 pr-2">&#128078; CONS:</b><ul class="list-unstyled ticks-pros ticks-bad p-0"><li>The free version doesn’t have a plagiarism checker</li><li></li><li>Adding a translation feature to Grammarly would be fantastic</li></ul></div></div><p class="text-center mt-4 mb-4 p-4"><a class="btn btn-warning btn-custom-2 jumpy" href="https://grammarly.pxf.io/c/2996736/3025286/31551?subId1=lugchga49z21il2kyzpgw" title="Grammarly" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Get Grammarly - Improve Your Writing Skill!</a></p><div class="mt-4 mb-3"><b>SEE WHAT USERS HAVE TO SAY </b><br /><br /><strong>Trustpilot Rating:</strong> 4.6 out of 8,320 reviews<br /><br /><i>"Grammarly is an app that has helped me improve my writing skills by leaps and bounds. I have used the app for over a year, which has helped me with my grammar. The app ensures that all my grammar is correct, making writing much more effective."</i><br /><br /><i>"I have had the privilege of using Grammarly's services for my college papers, and I must say that I am thoroughly impressed with the level of assistance it offers. As a student, I recognize the significance of producing well-written and coherent papers, and Grammarly has undoubtedly been a valuable companion."</i><br /><br /><i>"I suffered a brain illness that left me permanently disabled. The effects of the disease made it especially hard for me to write like I used to. And I love to write but it was frustrating until I started using Grammarly. I still make mistakes and don't form my sentences correctly as I type but I noticed I am getting better. So thank you Grammarly for your program. Without it, I would have had to stop writing altogether."</i><br /><br /><i>"I have found Grammarly so beneficial for my studies. I had not attempted any academic study for many years. Last year I signed up for a University course and decided to invest in Grammarly as I was not very confident in my skills. Grammarly made such a huge difference, and five stars just for that is so worthy. Just this past week, my subscription was renewed, (it was my mistake as there are options not to renew your subscription). I am not studying at the moment, and funds are a little low at preset, so I contacted Grammarly and was refunded with no fuss. I will renew my subscription in September when I start a full-time college course.I just can not sing the praises of Grammarly and its staff enough. Thank you."</i><br /><br /><br /><b>WHAT IS GRAMMARLY? </b><br /><br />Grammarly is an AI-powered writing assistant that can help you improve your writing skills by identifying and correcting grammatical, spelling, punctuation, and other errors in your text.
