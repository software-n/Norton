But sometimes they felt too expensive or just "too old", so finally, we decided on the ClickUp Business plan last year - what a game changer that was! Now transparency is guaranteed as everyone knows exactly where their tasks are at any given moment. It's been one of the best decisions for 2022 so far: reliable automation & estimates plus multiple views of the same boards...it really has everything you need!"</i><br /><br /><i>"A ticket is a tool every company should be using. It is an all-in-one tool. Managing projects, interviews, staff, documentation, bug tickets and many more. The automation feature comes with a vast range of automation you can use. It has increased productivity and helped everyone become more organised. We always had the issue of cross-team collaboration. Data would always be missed out because it needed to be remembered. In ClickUp, we have everything documented in the documentation and tickets assigned to the features list in the documentation. Overall, ClickUp does a great job of shrinking multiple applications/Websites into one. One login, one website."</i><br /><br /><i>"I've been using clickup for 3 years now and will never go back to any of the other software I've used for task management. Clickup can seem daunting and intimidating to a lot of people, but if you take the time to learn the software and watch their help and setup videos, you will love the product. I highly recommend it to all."</i><br /><br /><br /><b>WHO SHOULD USE CLICKUP? </b><br /><br />ClickUp is a versatile project management tool that can be used by a wide range of individuals and teams.
