This tool is especially beneficial for sales teams that need to keep track of their expenses and revenue. With this feature, you can set budgets for specific projects or campaigns, assign team members to specific tasks, and monitor spending in real-time. <br /><br />The budget status is represented visually on the platform, showing you the total spend, remaining budget, and percentage completed.

This integration streamlines financial management processes and automates the transfer of data between systems, reducing the probability of errors and enhancing efficiency. <br /><br />Overall, Monday.com's budget tracking feature in the CRM module is a robust tool that can aid you in managing your budgets more efficiently and effectively.<br /><br /><b>Email Sync</b><br /><br />The email sync feature in Monday.com CRM enables a complete synchronization of your Gmail/Outlook accounts, allowing you to send and receive emails directly from the app. It also logs all your sent and received emails to their respective boards, saving time and ensuring that all client communications are tracked and centrally organized. <br /><br />You and your team will know exactly what's been sent or received, when it was sent or received, and who it was received from. This helps you stay informed, efficient, and aligned with your team. It also simplifies relationship management, facilitates deal follow-ups, and enhances customer service. In addition, this feature lets you customize your email templates and set up automated email campaigns to save even more time and stay engaged with your clients.<br /><br /><div class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../../images/mondaycrm6.png"></div><br /><b>Dependencies</b><br /><br />Tasks are often passed from one team member to the next to finish a project, just like in a relay race. Unlike in a relay race, however, some project tasks can't begin until other tasks have been done. This link between two tasks is called a "dependency." <br /><br />To set up dependencies, you can simply go to the item that you want to create a dependency for, click on the dependencies column, and select the item that the current item is dependent on. You can also set the type of dependency (such as "Finish to Start", "Start to Start", "Finish to Finish", or "Start to Finish") and add any relevant notes or information.<br /><br />Once you have set up your dependencies, you can view them on your board in several different ways, such as by using the Gantt view or by using the Timeline view. This allows you to see how different tasks are related and how they impact each other's timelines.<br /><br />The dependencies feature can be very useful for project management, as it helps ensure that tasks are completed in the correct order and can prevent delays or errors. It can also help you manage and prioritize your workload more effectively, by showing you which tasks are dependent on others and which ones can be started independently.<br /><br /><b>Merge Duplicate Data</b><br /><br />The merge duplicate data feature in Monday.com is a powerful tool that can help you consolidate and clean up your CRM data by merging duplicate entries into a single, unified record. When working with a CRM system, it's common to have duplicate entries, such as multiple contacts or leads for the same customer, and this can lead to confusion and inefficiency in the sales process. With the merge feature, duplicates can be automatically detected based on predefined criteria, such as email address or name, and you can choose to merge all the data from both duplicate entries or select specific fields to merge. <br /><br />If you come across duplicates with conflicting data, such as different phone numbers or job titles, you can choose which data to keep or merge. You can also customize the criteria used to detect duplicates by adding additional fields or adjusting the sensitivity of the matching algorithm. Additionally, Monday.com keeps a record of all merge actions, including who performed the merge and when, to provide an audit trail for future reference. By using Monday.com's merge feature, you can maintain a clean and efficient CRM system by consolidating duplicate data entries into a single, unified record.<br /><br /><b>Data Import</b><br /><br />If you're looking to import your existing customer data into Monday.com CRM, you'll be happy to know that the data import feature makes it quick and easy to do so.
