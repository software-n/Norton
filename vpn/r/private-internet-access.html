/><i>“Having the option to run my VPN for specific apps only makes all the difference. I have it on my phone and PC and it has worked great for me. I can also put it on routers that support VPN. Has worked great for me.”</i><br /><br /><i>“PIA is the most seamless and easy to use of the VPN's on the market and I have tried them all. I get the best download speeds while running it. It's secure, fast, and updated often, and the vpn killswitch feature that allows programs only to run when VPN is active is great. For those super worried about their privacy, They truly are the only big VPN that doesn't keep files on their customers' usage. Just google the others that say they do, they have given up info on clients.”</i><br /><br /><i>“I've tried many different VPN apps, this one is the one I keep coming back to. PIA is really the best one out there. So easy, user-friendly, great customer service when needed. I recommend it 100%.”</i><br /><br /><i>“Works independently. So nice that Private Internet Access can do everything without my help- because I would mess things up. So important also that it begins at startup. PIA protects this computer without me doing anything. Love it.”</i><br /><br /><br /><b>WHO IS BEHIND PRIVATE INTERNET ACCESS?</b> <br /><br />Private Internet Access (PIA) was founded in 2010 by London Trust Media, Inc. as a VPN service provider. The company was started to provide privacy and security solutions to Internet users and to promote Internet freedom. In 2019, it was acquired by Kape Technologies, which also owns two other reputable VPNs: Cyberghost and ExpressVPN. <br /><br />Kape Technologies is a cybersecurity and online privacy company headquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel. It was formed in 2016, and provides a range of internet security products and services, including anti-malware software, virtual private networks (VPNs), and web security solutions.<br /><br />The acquisition was part of Kape's strategy to expand its portfolio of cybersecurity and online privacy products. PIA is a well-known VPN provider, known for its strong privacy policies and user-friendly software. The acquisition of PIA helped Kape to strengthen its position in the VPN market and provide a comprehensive range of privacy and security solutions to its customers. <br /><br /><div class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../../images/piavpn4.png"></div><br /><b>HOW DOES IT WORK? </b><br /><br />Private Internet Access (PIA) works by encrypting your internet connection and routing it through its own servers. When you use PIA's VPN service, your internet traffic is redirected through one of PIA's servers, making it appear as if your internet traffic is coming from the server rather than your device. This protects your online privacy and security by hiding your IP address, encrypting your internet traffic, and preventing others from monitoring or accessing your internet activity. Additionally, PIA's VPN service also allows you to bypass internet censorship and geo-restrictions, giving you access to the internet as if you were in a different location.<br /><br />Some of the benefits of using Private Internet Access (PIA) are:<br /><br />1. <strong> Online privacy:</strong> PIA protects your online privacy by encrypting your internet traffic and hiding your IP address.<br /><br />2. <strong> Security:</strong> PIA's VPN service provides a secure and encrypted connection, making it difficult for others to monitor or access your internet activity.<br /><br />3. <strong> Access to restricted content:</strong> With PIA, you can bypass internet censorship and geo-restrictions to access websites and content that may be restricted in your location.<br /><br />4. <strong> Multiple devices:</strong> PIA supports multiple devices and platforms, including Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and more, allowing you to protect all of your devices with a single subscription.<br /><br />5. <strong> No logs policy:</strong> PIA has a strict no-logs policy, meaning they do not collect or store any information about your internet activity.<br /><br />6. <strong> Affordability:</strong> PIA is one of the most affordable VPN services available, with flexible subscription plans to fit different budgets and requirements.<br /><br />7. <strong> Customer support:</strong> PIA provides 24/7 customer support through live chat and email, helping you resolve any issues you may have with their VPN service.<br /><br /><br /><b>WHO IS IT FOR? </b><br /><br />Private Internet Access (PIA) is ideal for individuals or organizations who are concerned about their online privacy and security and want to protect their internet connection from being monitored or accessed by others. PIA is also ideal for those who want to bypass internet censorship and geo-restrictions to access websites and content that may be restricted in their location. This includes users who want to access content from streaming services, such as Netflix, or who want to use public Wi-Fi securely. PIA is also suitable for people who need to connect to the internet from different locations or devices, as it supports multiple devices and platforms. Additionally, PIA is an affordable VPN service, making it ideal for users who are looking for a cost-effective solution to protect their online privacy and security.<br /><br /><br /><b>WILL IT KEEP ME ANONYMOUS ONLINE?</b><br /><br />Private Internet Access is owned by Private Internet (formerly known as KAPE Technologies and, before that, Crossrider). Yes, it’s the same company that owns Cyberghost and Zenmate. This might trigger your anxiety, given that it has a dubious history of producing malware/adware. But, of course, we did some digging, and it seems like PIA's parent has since left the malware business and now thrives in cybersecurity. So, until something suspicious comes up, we'll consider this issue as nothing but a historical footnote.<br /><br />Nowadays, Private Internet Access (PIA) is known for its transparency in its business practices, particularly with regards to user privacy. PIA has a strict no-logging policy, which means that it does not keep records of users' online activities. According to their privacy policy, they do not collect or store any logs of their users' activities, including internet traffic data, DNS queries, timestamps, IP addresses, or browsing history. PIA states that they only collect minimal, non-identifying data, such as the amount of bandwidth used, for the purpose of improving their services. This policy helps to protect the privacy of PIA users and ensures that their online data is not being monitored or collected.<br /><br />Of course, virtually every VPN can make the same claim, only to reveal later that they store information that can be used to track your online activities. Fortunately, Private Internet Access has everything to back up this claim. Firstly, PIA's no-logs policy has been independently audited. The company invited Deloitte to conduct staff interviews, inspect its VPN and other servers, as well as evaluate its policies and procedures. The report by Deloitte found no evidence of privacy concerns and concluded that the policy accurately described how PIA configures and manages its systems to prevent logging. There are actual cases that support this too! In 2016, the FBI asked PIA for information about one of its customers, but the company didn't have anything to give. In another case, the Russian government took over some PIA servers but found nothing.<br /><br />PIA also provides transparency around its server network, including the location of its servers, the encryption protocols used, and the level of security provided. The company is transparent about its business practices and policies and makes them easily accessible to its users. Additionally, PIA actively engages with its users through its website and social media channels and is responsive to customer inquiries and concerns.<br /><br />Private Internet Access (PIA) has a bug bounty program that rewards security researchers and individuals who report vulnerabilities in its systems and applications. The program is designed to encourage reporting of security vulnerabilities in a responsible manner and incentivize security researchers to identify and report any potential security risks. The rewards offered under the program are based on the severity of the reported vulnerability and the quality of the report. The program is intended to provide a safe and secure platform for users of PIA services and to help the company continuously improve its security posture. PIA's bug bounty program is part of its commitment to providing its customers with the highest level of security and privacy.<br /><br />Now, here is where it gets real juicy. Private VPN offers dedicated IPs in five locations: US, Canada, UK, Australia, and Germany. Unlike shared IP, a dedicated IP is unique to your account, so you get the same one every time you log in. This makes it a lot safer because you're less likely to suffer the consequences of someone else's shady online activities.<br /><br />If there is still one thing that may not sit well with other users, it’s that Private Internet Access is based in the US and therefore is a member of the 5/9/14 Eyes Alliances. But we don't see how this could be a problem, given that this VPN provider has a strict and court-tested no-log policy. Even if they receive subpoenas requesting user data (which they did in the past), they simply would have no data to hand over.<br /><br /><div class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../../images/piavpn5.png"></div><br /><b>IS PIA SECURE?</b> <br /><br />Private Internet Access is pretty impenetrable when it comes to privacy. However, what about safety? PIA helps to keep you safe and anonymous online by encrypting your internet traffic and hiding your IP address. When you connect to the internet through PIA's VPN service, your internet traffic is routed through one of PIA's servers, where it is encrypted and securely transmitted to your destination. This makes it difficult for others to monitor or access your internet activity, as your internet traffic appears to be coming from PIA's server rather than from your device.<br /><br />PIA also supports multiple VPN protocols, allowing you to choose the best protocol for your needs and requirements. The available protocols may vary depending on the device and platform you are using, so be sure to check the supported protocols for your device before selecting a VPN protocol.<br /><br />The protocols used by PIA include:<br /><br /><li><strong>PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol):</strong> PPTP is an older VPN protocol that is still widely used and provides fast speeds. However, it is not as secure as some other VPN protocols.<br /><br /><li><strong>L2TP/IPSec (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol with Internet Protocol Security):</strong> L2TP/IPSec is a newer and more secure VPN protocol that provides a high level of encryption for your internet connection.<br /><br /><li><strong>OpenVPN:</strong> OpenVPN is an open-source VPN protocol that provides a high level of encryption and security for your internet connection. It is the recommended VPN protocol for most users as it provides fast speeds and strong security.<br /><br /><li><strong>WireGuard:</strong> WireGuard is a new and modern VPN protocol that provides a fast and secure connection. It is designed to be lightweight, simple, and efficient, making it an ideal VPN protocol for users who need a fast and reliable VPN connection.<br /><br />Private Internet Access also uses RAM-only servers for its network, which is great for privacy. Instead of using hard drives, which store data and need to be wiped manually, RAM servers are designed to clear all data when they are restarted automatically. This means that with the flick of a switch, all stored data is removed, providing a much higher level of privacy and security.<br /><br />Overall, PIA's dedication to transparency and user privacy is one of the reasons it is regarded as one of the most reliable VPN providers on the market.<br /><br /><br /><b>WHAT ARE THE FEATURES? </b> <br /><br />Private Internet Access VPN provides various features to help protect your online privacy and security, such as VPN encryption, VPN Router, WireGuard®, split tunneling, ad and malware blocker, a kill switch, and more. You can learn more about all the features of Private Internet Access VPN here.<br /><br /><b>VPN Encryption </b><br /><br />Whenever you link to the Private Internet Access VPN, you and the server share a secret encryption key. Your information will be unreadable to anyone who doesn't have the decryption key, including your ISP, network administrators, and government censors. Anyone snooping on your connection will only learn that you're using a virtual private network, but not when or for how long.<br /><br />The PIA server will give you an IP address that makes it hard to figure out where you are and makes a safe tunnel for sending your internet data. PIA uses the same encryption methods used by governments, intelligence agencies, and the military. You can tweak PIA's 128-bit or 256-bit AES encryption settings even more to meet your own needs.<br /><br /><b>Open-Source Transparency </b><br /><br />Private Internet Access is one of the few premier VPN providers that offer 100% open-source VPN apps, meaning that their code is available for anyone to view and analyze. This is a way of showing that they have nothing to hide, but you don't have to take their word for it - you can independently verify this for yourself!<br /><br /><div class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../../images/piavpn6.png"></div><br /><b>WireGuard® </b><br /><br />Private Internet Access WireGuard® is a VPN protocol offered by the VPN provider Private Internet Access. WireGuard® is a modern, high-performance VPN protocol that is designed to be lightweight, secure, and easy to use.<br /><br />Compared to other VPN protocols such as OpenVPN and IPSec, WireGuard® is faster and uses fewer system resources. It also has stronger encryption and better security features than older protocols.<br /><br />Private Internet Access offers a customized implementation of WireGuard® that is specifically optimized for their VPN service. PIA WireGuard® is available on all major platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.<br /><br />PIA WireGuard® encrypts and protects all internet traffic between your device and the VPN server, preventing third parties from intercepting or snooping on the traffic. <br /><br /><b>Split-tunneling </b><br /><br />Private Internet Access (PIA) offers you the Split Tunneling feature, allowing you to decide which internet traffic goes through the VPN tunnel and which traffic goes directly to the internet. You can whitelist specific applications or websites to bypass the VPN connection or blacklist ones that always require a secure and private VPN connection.<br /><br />This feature can come in handy when dealing with applications or websites that don't work properly with a VPN or when accessing local resources such as printers or file servers. PIA's Split Tunneling feature is available on all major platforms like Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS, and can be configured easily from within the PIA VPN client or mobile app.<br /><br /><b>Kill Switch</b><br /><br />This feature is specifically designed to safeguard your internet connection if your VPN connection is lost or interrupted, ensuring that no information leaks outside the VPN tunnel.<br /><br />When you enable the kill switch, it will automatically terminate your internet connection if there's any VPN connection loss or interruption, protecting sensitive information from being transmitted over an unsecured connection.<br /><br />You can access PIA's kill switch feature on all major platforms, like Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. You can enable or disable the kill switch simply from within the PIA VPN client or mobile app.<br /><br />Please note that turning on the kill switch feature may affect some applications or services that depend on an internet connection for connectivity, like online gaming or video streaming. As a user, you should be conscious of this before enabling the kill switch feature and consider using split-tunneling to selectively re-route traffic outside the VPN tunnel for these types of applications.<br /><br /><b>Corporate VPN</b><br /><br />As a business or organization, you can benefit from PIA's Corporate VPN feature. This feature provides a dedicated VPN server that allows your employees to connect securely to your company's internal network from remote locations like home or public Wi-Fi networks.<br /><br />The Corporate VPN feature comes with a unique IP address that can be customized with your company's branding, and it includes advanced security features such as multi-factor authentication, custom encryption settings, and dedicated support.<br /><br />You can use PIA's Corporate VPN on a variety of devices and operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android. It supports multiple VPN protocols like OpenVPN and WireGuard to give you more flexibility.<br /><br />PIA's Corporate VPN is scalable and can cater to businesses of any size - from small startups to large enterprises. Additionally, it can seamlessly integrate with your existing IT infrastructure and cloud services such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.<br /><br />Overall, PIA's Corporate VPN feature is an excellent VPN solution that provides a secure and reliable way for businesses and organizations to connect their remote employees to their internal network. It comes equipped with advanced security features and can be customized to suit the specific needs of your company.<br /><br /><b>Router VPN </b><br /><br />If you want to protect all devices on your home network with a VPN connection, you can use PIA's router VPN feature. By installing PIA's VPN software on a compatible router, you can route all internet traffic from your devices through the VPN tunnel, providing privacy and security for all connected devices.<br /><br />PIA supports a variety of routers from popular brands such as ASUS, Netgear, Linksys, and TP-Link. However, not all routers are compatible with PIA's VPN software, so you should check PIA's website for a list of supported routers before purchasing a new router.<br /><br />Once you have set up a compatible router with PIA's VPN software, you can configure VPN settings such as server location, encryption level, and protocol. You can set up split-tunneling to selectively route traffic through the VPN tunnel and configure other advanced settings.<br /><br />Using a router VPN can be more convenient than installing the VPN software on each individual device, especially if you have multiple devices or if some devices do not support VPN connections. It can also help improve internet speeds by reducing the processing load on individual devices.<br /><br /><div class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../../images/piavpn7.png"></div><br /><b>ARE THERE ADDITIONAL FEATURES? </b><br /><br />PIA goes above and beyond to protect your privacy and give you the freedom to browse. Here are a few more features you can get from this VPN provider:<br /><br /><b>Antivirus </b><br /><br />Private Internet Access (PIA) offers privacy-focused antivirus software that helps keep your devices secure without logging any data or tracking your activities. The antivirus is available to download as an add-on to the award-winning PIA VPN app for Windows.<br /><br />Comprehensive Cloud-based Protection: Private Internet Access (PIA) antivirus software provides real-time protection from a variety of threats, including viruses, ransomware, rootkits, worms, trojans, and spyware. Its cloud-based database is constantly updated to identify the latest malware as soon as it appears.<br /><br />Protection against Zero-Day Attacks: To further strengthen your PC's defenses against unknown threats and vulnerabilities that have not yet been patched by Microsoft, a Prevention Engine has been added to the software. This engine helps protect your PC against emerging zero-day threats and provides additional layers of security.<br /><br />Safe Browsing Online: Private Internet Access (PIA) antivirus has a built-in Web Shield that utilizes a DNS-based ad-blocker. This Web Shield scans all URLs visited, protecting users from intrusive and malicious ads and trackers on websites.<br /><br />Privacy-first Antivirus: Private Internet Access (PIA) takes your privacy seriously, and their antivirus software does not log or store any of your data. You can choose to receive notifications when the antivirus contacts the cloud servers for scanning for malware, and you can also control what data is sent to the virus databases, which is not possible with many other antivirus tools.<br /><br />Dual VPN + Antivirus Protection: With PIA antivirus, you can get the combined benefits of both VPN and antivirus protection. As an add-on to your regular PIA VPN subscription, you can get the added layer of security that comes with antivirus protection.<br /><br /><b>Ad Blocker</b><br /><br />If you want to block online ads, trackers, and malware, you can use PIA's ad blocker feature called PIA MACE as part of their VPN service. PIA MACE is designed to protect your privacy and security while browsing the internet by filtering out unwanted content at the DNS level, preventing ads and trackers from ever loading in the first place. This can help to improve browsing speeds and reduce data usage while also providing a more streamlined and secure browsing experience.<br /><br />In addition, PIA MACE also helps to protect you from malware and phishing attempts by blocking access to known malicious domains and IP addresses that can cause harm to your device.<br /><br />PIA MACE is available on all major platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. You can easily enable or disable the ad blocker from within the PIA VPN client or mobile app.<br /><br />Overall, PIA MACE can provide a useful tool for blocking ads, trackers, and malware, helping to protect your privacy and security while browsing the internet. However, it's important to note that some websites or services may not work properly with the ad blocker enabled, as they may rely on ads or tracking to function properly, so you should test the feature thoroughly to ensure everything is working as expected.<br /><br /><b>Public Wi-Fi Protection</b><br /><br />This feature is designed to encrypt your internet traffic and route it through a secure VPN tunnel, which can help protect your online activity from being intercepted or monitored by hackers or other malicious actors on the network.<br /><br />PIA's public Wi-Fi protection feature is available on all major platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. You can simply connect to a PIA VPN server before connecting to a public Wi-Fi network to ensure that your traffic is secure and your online activity is private.<br /><br />Overall, PIA's public Wi-Fi protection feature can be a useful tool for protecting your privacy and security while using public Wi-Fi networks, which can be vulnerable to hacking and other security threats, so it's worth considering if you frequently use public Wi-Fi.<br /><br /><b>Email Breach Scanning</b><br /><br />If you want to check whether your email address has been compromised in data breaches and leaks, you can use Private Internet Access' (PIA) email breach scanning feature as part of their VPN service. This feature allows you to compare your email address against a database of known data breaches and leaks so that you can stay informed and take proactive steps to protect your online privacy and security.<br /><br />If a match is found, PIA will notify you and provide recommendations for securing your account and changing your password. This feature can be particularly useful if you have reused passwords across multiple accounts, as a compromised email address can be used to gain access to other accounts and personal information.<br /><br />PIA's email breach scanning feature is available on all major platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. You can access the feature through the PIA VPN client or mobile app and can scan multiple email addresses at once.<br /><br />Overall, PIA's email breach scanning feature can be a useful tool for staying informed about data breaches and leaks and can help you to take proactive steps to protect your online privacy and security. It's worth considering if you want to stay on top of data breaches and protect your personal information online.<br /><br /><div class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../../images/piavpn3.png"></div><br /><br /><b>SERVER NETWORK</b><br /><br />PIA has a massive server list ( a whopping 35,000 servers in 84 countries ) with excellent global coverage, allowing you to access content from all over the world. Having a large server network is beneficial for speed, as it helps avoid overcrowding which can slow down connections. Additionally, it makes it harder for websites to detect IPs being used by multiple people. Furthermore, having so many servers makes finding one close to you easier, which gives you the best connection speeds.<br /><br />Is a dedicated IP address available from PIA? Yes. But first, what exactly is a dedicated address? A dedicated IP address is an internet protocol (IP) address that is exclusively assigned to a single website or web hosting account. In contrast to a shared IP address, which is used by multiple websites on the same server, a dedicated IP address ensures that only one website is associated with that particular IP address.<br /><br />One of the primary benefits of a dedicated IP address is that it provides more control over your website and server. It allows you to access your website and server using a unique IP address, which can be important for certain types of applications, such as email or SSL certificates. Additionally, it can help to improve your website's performance, security, and reliability. This also helps to avoid constant CAPTCHA checks and getting flagged on safe sites. <br /><br />For PIA, the cost of this feature, which is typically extra, is a reasonable $5 per month. But keep in mind that only the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and Germany offer this option. In contrast to other VPNs like CyberGhost that offer Dedicated IPs in more locations, it is regrettably unavailable in more places.<br /><br /><br /><b>HOW FAST IS IT?</b><br /><br />Given its high server count, we expected PIA to perform really well in terms of speed. After all, it’s unlikely for one server to be overcrowded with a network this extensive. Is that assumption correct? Let’s find out.<br /><br />Before connecting to the VPN speed, our download speed was at 90.2 Mbps. We then connected to a nearby server in NY, and our speed dropped to 40.5 Mbps. We tried this several times and were surprised that the results were pretty inconsistent. We disconnected from the server and tried a few minutes later. During the subsequent tests, the speed fluctuated between 50Mbps to 20Mbps. We then tried connecting to a server across the world. Connecting to a server in Japan gave us a download speed of 12Mbps. It’s a considerable drop of 87%, but we could still jump on an hour-long Zoom meeting without interruption. All in all, we got decent speeds, but the inconsistency might frustrate some users.<br /><br /><br /><b>IS THERE A FREE VERSION? </b><br /><br />Private Internet Access (PIA) does not offer a completely free version of its VPN service. However, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for new users, which allows users to try out the VPN risk-free for a limited time.<br /><br />Additionally, PIA frequently offers discounts and promotions on their VPN service, which can make it more affordable for users who are looking for a budget-friendly option. They also offer different subscription plans with varying pricing and features, so users can choose the plan that best fits their needs and budget.<br /><br />While PIA does not offer a completely free version of its VPN service, its money-back guarantee and discounted pricing options can provide a way for users to try out the VPN without committing to a long-term subscription.<br /><br /><br /><b>HOW MUCH IS IT? </b><br /><br />Private Internet Access has three billing options, all of which are covered by a 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee. The month-to-month plan costs $9.95, which is quite pricey, considering that you can get a decent VPN at $5 per month. The annual plan is a better option as the price drops from $9.95 to $3.33 per month. However, the real value kicks in when you get the 2-year plan where you get 2 months extra for free as well as a boxcryptor cloud security license- all for a low price of $2.03 per month. It's also worth noting that you get the same exact features no matter which tier you select.<br /><br /><br /><b>IS IT EASY TO USE? </b><br /><br />Private Internet Access (PIA) is generally considered to be an easy-to-use VPN service. They offer dedicated VPN clients for all major platforms, which are designed to be user-friendly and intuitive.<br /><br />The PIA VPN clients feature a simple and straightforward interface with easy-to-use controls for connecting to the VPN, selecting servers, and adjusting settings. The clients also provide helpful information and tips to guide users through the VPN setup process and ensure that they are using the service correctly.<br /><br /><br /><b>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND IMPACT ON SYSTEM RESOURCES</b><br /><br />Private Internet Access (PIA) is designed to be compatible with a wide range of platforms and devices and has relatively modest system requirements. Here are the minimum requirements for running PIA on different platforms:<br /><br /><strong>Windows:</strong> Windows 7 or later<br /><strong>macOS:</strong> macOS 10.13 or later<br /><strong>Linux:</strong> Ubuntu 18.04 or later, Fedora 28 or later, Debian 9 or later, Mint 19 or later<br /><strong>Android:</strong> Android 5.0 or later<br /><strong>iOS:</strong> iOS 12 or later<br /><strong>Chrome/Firefox/Opera:</strong> Latest version of the browser<br /><br />In terms of impact on system resources, PIA is designed to be lightweight and unobtrusive, and generally has a minimal impact on system performance. However, like any VPN service, PIA may cause a slight slowdown in internet speeds due to the extra processing required to encrypt and route internet traffic through the VPN servers.<br /><br />The impact on system resources can also vary depending on the user's device and internet connection. For example, older or less powerful devices may experience a greater impact on performance, while users with slower internet connections may notice a greater slowdown in internet speeds.<br /><br />Overall, PIA has modest system requirements and is designed to be lightweight and unobtrusive, with minimal impact on system resources. However, users may notice a slight impact on performance and internet speeds due to the nature of VPN technology.<br /><br /><div class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../../images/piavpn2.png"></div><br /><br /><b>PRIVATE INTERNET ACCESS ON-THE-GO</b><br /><br />Private Internet Access (PIA) is compatible with both Android and iOS devices and offers dedicated VPN apps for both platforms. Here is some information on how PIA performs on the go:<br /><br />Android: PIA's Android app is well-designed and easy to use, with a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to connect to the VPN with just a few taps. The app offers a range of features, including split-tunnelling, malware protection, and ad-blocking, which can be customized to the user's specific needs. PIA's Android app generally performs well on mobile devices, with relatively fast connection speeds and minimal impact on battery life.<br /><br />iOS: PIA's iOS app is similarly well-designed and user-friendly, with a streamlined interface that makes it easy to connect to the VPN and access advanced features. The app includes a range of privacy and security features, including a kill switch and ad-blocking, and is optimized for use on mobile devices. PIA's iOS app generally performs well, with reliable connections and minimal impact on battery life.<br /><br />In general, PIA is a good choice for users who need a reliable and easy-to-use VPN for on-the-go use. The dedicated apps for Android and iOS are well-designed and user-friendly, with a range of features that can help users stay secure and private while using their mobile devices. However, as with any VPN service, connection speeds and performance can vary depending on factors such as the user's location and internet connection quality.<br /><br /><br /><b>CUSTOMER SUPPORT</b><br /><br />Private Internet Access (PIA) provides customer support via a range of channels, including email, live chat, and a support ticket system.

Yes! Although we were unhappy with the inconsistent speeds, you can always switch to one of the 35,000 servers. For $2.69 per month, we get solid internet privacy, data protection, unlimited bandwidth, simultaneous connections of up to 10 devices, and efficient customer support. Nonetheless, it's not without any flaws. If you're heading to the far east, know that Private Internet Access does not work in China.<br /><br /><br /><b>FAQ</b><br /><br /><b>Does Private Internet Access have a free trial?</b><br /><br />Private Internet Access (PIA) does not offer a free trial, but they do have a 30-day money-back guarantee for its VPN service. This means that you can sign up for PIA and use the service for up to 30 days, and if you are not satisfied with the service for any reason, you can request a full refund. However, it's worth noting that PIA has a reputation for being a reliable and trustworthy VPN service, so it's unlikely that you'll need to take advantage of the money-back guarantee.<br /><br /><b>How do I install Private Internet Access?</b><br /><br />PIA can be installed on a variety of devices, including desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and tablets. Here are the general steps to install PIA on a desktop or laptop computer:<br /><br />1. Sign up for a Private Internet Access account by clicking on the link below. <br /><br />2. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) from the PIA website.<br /><br />3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install the software on your computer.<br /><br />4. Once the installation is complete, launch the PIA application and enter your PIA login credentials.<br /><br />5. Select a server location from the list of available options and click the Connect button.<br /><br />6. Once you're connected to the VPN, your internet traffic will be encrypted and routed through the selected server location.<br /><br />Note: The exact steps may vary slightly depending on the operating system you are using and the version of the PIA software you have installed. PIA also has detailed installation guides on its website that provide step-by-step instructions for various devices and operating systems.<br /><br /><b>Can I use PIA on multiple devices? </b><br /><br />Yes, you can use Private Internet Access (PIA) on multiple devices simultaneously. PIA offers support for a wide range of devices, including desktop and laptop computers, smartphones, and tablets, and allows users to connect up to 10 devices at the same time using a single PIA account.<br /><br />To use PIA on multiple devices, simply download and install the PIA software on each device and log in to your PIA account using your login credentials. You can then select a server location and connect to the VPN on each device as needed.<br /><br />It's worth noting that while PIA allows for multiple simultaneous connections, using a VPN on multiple devices at the same time can impact your internet speed and performance, so it's important to consider your bandwidth limitations when using PIA on multiple devices.<br /><br /><b>Does Private Internet Access work anywhere in the world? </b><br /><br />Private Internet Access works in most countries around the world as long as there is an internet connection available. PIA has servers in more than 78 countries, including North America, Europe, Asia, South America, Africa, and Oceania, so that users can connect to the VPN virtually anywhere in the world. There are some exceptions, however, due to embargoes against certain countries by the US, which PIA must abide by as an American-based company. Currently, PIA is unavailable in Burundi, The Crimea region of Ukraine, Cuba, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, and the Taliban Occupied Region of Afghanistan. PIA is also unavailable in countries that block or restrict the use of a VPN: Turkey, China, Russia, Egypt, UAE, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Sri Lanka. <br /><br /><b>Is PIA a member of the 14 Eyes Alliance, and should I be worried? </b><br /><br />No, Private Internet Access (PIA) is not located in a Fourteen Eyes country. PIA is headquartered in the United States, which is a Five Eyes country, but they have a strict no-logging policy that ensures that they do not collect or retain any user data or activity logs.<br /><br />The Five Eyes countries are a group of intelligence-sharing countries that includes the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The Fourteen Eyes countries are an expanded group that includes the Five Eyes countries, as well as Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. These countries are known for their close intelligence-sharing relationships, which can raise concerns for privacy-conscious users.<br /><br />While PIA is headquartered in a Five Eyes country, its no-logging policy means that they do not collect or share user data with any third parties, including governments or intelligence agencies. Additionally, PIA has implemented strong security and encryption measures to protect user privacy and ensure that user data remains private and secure.<br /><br />Overall, while it's important to consider the jurisdiction and location of a VPN service when choosing a provider, PIA's no-logging policy and security measures make it a good choice for users who prioritize privacy and security.<br /><br /><b>How many devices can I connect to the VPN service simultaneously?</b><br /><br />Private Internet Access provides limitless simultaneous connections to its services through a single subscription, which can contain a combination of routers, computers, or mobile devices of your preference. The VPN service can be installed on any number of devices at any given time. However, PIA recommends using router configuration for home setups that require numerous devices and when VPN is used on mobile devices in addition to home devices. This ensures that all devices behind the router are recognized as a single connection to PIA's network, allowing you to use mobile devices elsewhere without the risk of a home connection using multiple logins at the same time.<p class="text-center mt-4 mb-4 p-4"><a class="btn btn-warning btn-custom-2 jumpy"
