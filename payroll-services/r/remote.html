I personally really like the Career Hub feature where you can log notes about your work in a journal - very helpful to keep track of your achievements!"</i><br /><br /><i>"This is simply the best alternative for hiring and getting remote jobs. They will make the whole experience simple and fast. They seamlessly handle all the processes. They know the local laws and handle communications perfectly. On top of that, their platform is fast, well-designed, simple and works really well. Their support is fast and effective too."</i><br /><br /><i>"Remote has been a total game-changer for our scale-up. We’ve grown 300% YoY, hiring fast and globally, and Remote has been the trusted partner we needed to scale.<br /><br />Their platform is intuitive and makes everything effortless—onboarding, payroll, compliance, contractor payments.<br /><br />The Sales and CS teams have been incredible and their expansion and legal experts have stepped in with invaluable advice whenever we needed it.<br /><br />Even when we faced tricky situations, their Support and Payroll teams went above and beyond to ensure everything was sorted quickly and professionally.<br /><br />5 stars all the way! Remote is the partner every fast-growing company needs."</i><br /><br /><br /><b>WHAT EXACTLY IS REMOTE?</b><br /><br />Remote is a comprehensive global workforce management platform that helps businesses hire, pay, and manage employees and contractors in multiple countries—without the need to establish local entities. Designed for companies expanding their international teams, Remote provides payroll processing, tax compliance, benefits administration, and HR management tools, ensuring businesses remain compliant with local labor laws.<br /><br />Unlike traditional payroll providers, Remote owns and operates its own legal entities in the countries it serves, offering a streamlined, consistent, and secure experience without reliance on third-party intermediaries. Its Employer of Record (EOR) services, global payroll solutions, and contractor management tools allow businesses to scale internationally while reducing legal risks and administrative complexity.<br /><br />Remote also provides built-in legal expertise, IP protection, and localized benefits, ensuring both businesses and employees receive transparent, fair, and fully compliant workforce solutions. Whether you’re hiring full-time employees or managing global contractors, Remote helps you simplify global employment while maintaining control over payroll, compliance, and HR operations.<br /><br /><br /><b>WHO IS IT FOR? </b><br /><br />Remote is designed for businesses of all sizes looking to hire, pay, and manage international employees and contractors without the hassle of setting up local entities. It is particularly beneficial for startups and small businesses that want to expand globally while keeping overhead costs low. With its Employer of Record (EOR) services, companies can legally hire full-time employees in different countries without needing to establish a legal presence.<br /><br />For medium to large enterprises, Remote provides a scalable payroll and HR solution that centralizes international workforce management, ensuring compliance with local labor laws and tax regulations. Tech companies, SaaS businesses, and remote-first organizations benefit from its streamlined payroll, contractor management, and benefits administration, making it easier to manage global teams efficiently.<br /><br />Remote is also ideal for companies working with freelancers and independent contractors, offering a flexible, compliant contractor management system with automated payments in over 70 currencies. Additionally, industries with strict regulatory requirements, such as finance, healthcare, and professional services, can rely on Remote’s strong compliance framework and legal expertise to mitigate risks when hiring internationally.<br /><br />Whether you’re a fast-growing startup, an established multinational, or a company transitioning to a distributed workforce, Remote provides the tools, compliance assurance, and HR support needed to hire and manage employees across borders with confidence.<br /><br /><br /><b>WHAT ARE THE KEY FEATURES? </b><br /> <br />Remote is equipped with a range of features designed to streamline global workforce management:<br /><br /><b>Global Payroll</b><br /><br />Remote’s global payroll software streamlines payroll processing across multiple countries within a single platform. It provides a clear, organized system where payroll runs are categorized by country, each with a progress bar to track its status. If you prefer, you can view upcoming pay details by individual employees rather than by location. Remote’s implementation team will handle payroll setup based on your preferred cutoff and pay dates, ensuring a smooth and customized experience.<br /><br />Remote’s payroll software automatically factors in costs and deductions related to employee benefits, making sure everything is calculated accurately. It also determines employer tax contributions for each country, ensuring compliance with local tax laws. Whether you need to adjust salaries, process one-time bonuses, reimburse expenses, or account for paid time off, Remote’s platform simplifies the process.<br /><br />Once payroll is prepared, you can review estimated costs before finalizing. If everything looks correct, simply click “approve” to process payroll instantly. If any errors are detected, use the “request changes” button to highlight the issue. You can also communicate directly with Remote’s in-house payroll team using the built-in comments feature. After payroll is finalized, employees and HR teams can access digital payslips, and you can download payroll documents for both ongoing and completed pay runs.<br /><br />With its intuitive interface and automated compliance tools, Remote’s global payroll solution makes it easy to manage international payroll efficiently, reducing administrative burden and ensuring timely, accurate payments across borders.<br /><br /><b>Contractor Management</b><br /><br />Remote’s contractor management service is available in over 200 countries and includes a 30-day free trial, allowing you to test the platform before committing. You only pay for active contractors, so if a freelancer takes time off, you won’t be charged for that period.<br /><br />With self-service onboarding, contractors can enter their own details and complete identity verification, reducing administrative work for your team. You can onboard contractors individually or in bulk, making it easy to scale. Remote supports both individual freelancers and business entities, giving you the flexibility to work with a variety of contractors.<br /><br />When setting up contracts, you can use Remote’s customizable templates to generate compliant agreements quickly or upload your own. Remote’s in-house legal experts review contracts to ensure they meet local tax and employment regulations. If needed, you can also create bilingual contracts to facilitate clear communication between all parties.<br /><br />For payments, Remote supports 70+ currencies and allows you to pay contractors via credit card, ACH, or direct debit. Bulk payments simplify the process—you can approve multiple invoices with one click or set up automated smart approvals for recurring payments. If a contractor bills the same amount regularly, Remote can auto-generate invoices and schedule payments on a weekly, monthly, or bi-monthly basis.<br /><br />Remote’s invoice reports ensure accurate accounting, and the platform even pre-fills tax forms for contractors, making tax season easier. With its flexible, compliant, and automated contractor management system, Remote simplifies global freelancer payments and compliance, reducing administrative burden and ensuring smooth operations.<br /><br /><b>Employer of Record (EOR)</b><br /><br />Remote’s Employer of Record (EOR) services are available in about 80 countries. While this coverage is slightly less than some competitors, Remote owns all of its international entities, ensuring a consistent and reliable experience across countries. Many competitors rely on third-party legal entities to expand their EOR services, which can lead to inconsistent compliance, service delays, and varying levels of support. With Remote, you get a streamlined and transparent experience, no matter where you hire.<br /><br />When you hire employees through Remote’s EOR service, the platform handles payroll, taxes, benefits, and compliance for a flat monthly fee per employee. Remote’s onboarding process is designed to be fast and fully compliant, allowing you to integrate new hires within days instead of weeks. The system also includes mandatory identity verification and follows local employment regulations to ensure compliance from the start.<br /><br />You can customize onboarding details, including job roles, probation periods, salary structures, and benefits. Whether you’re adding a single new hire or onboarding multiple employees at once, Remote makes the process seamless. Employees are paid in their local currency, but you will receive a single consolidated bill in your preferred currency, simplifying financial management.<br /><br />Remote also provides valuable tools to support international hiring. The cost calculator helps you estimate the total expenses of hiring in a specific country, while the misclassification risk tool helps you determine if a contractor should be transitioned to full-time employment. With comprehensive EOR services and built-in compliance tools, Remote simplifies global hiring, allowing you to expand your workforce without setting up costly local entities.<br /><br /><b>Human Resource Information System (HRIS)</b><br /><br />Remote provides a limited but useful set of HRIS tools, available for free to businesses of any size. These features help streamline essential HR processes, including guided onboarding and offboarding, employee profile and document management, time off tracking, time tracking, and expense management with reimbursements. Employees also have access to a self-service portal, available on both the web and mobile app, allowing them to retrieve documents and manage requests without needing to contact HR directly.<br /><br />While Remote’s HRIS tools cover basic HR needs, they lack advanced features such as performance management, employee experience surveys, and in-depth workforce analytics, which are found in more robust HR platforms like BambooHR. If you require those functionalities, you may need to integrate Remote with third-party HR software.<br /><br />To support additional capabilities, Remote offers a handful of pre-built integrations with other platforms. You can also connect Remote to thousands of apps through Zapier or create custom integrations using the Remote API, making it possible to extend its functionality as your business grows. While not a full-fledged HR solution, Remote’s free HRIS tools provide a convenient and cost-effective way to manage core HR tasks, particularly for companies focusing on global workforce expansion.<br /><br /><b>Employer Dashboard</b><br /><br />Remote’s Employer Dashboard provides a centralized hub for managing and monitoring your global workforce with ease. The dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of employee and contractor data, payroll processing, compliance status, and key HR functions—all in one place.<br /><br />With an intuitive interface, you can quickly access critical workforce metrics, track onboarding progress, review payroll runs, and manage time off requests. The dashboard also allows you to view upcoming payments, monitor tax and benefits deductions, and ensure compliance with local labor laws across different countries.<br /><br />For companies hiring internationally, the Employer Dashboard simplifies workforce management by providing real-time insights and updates. Whether you need to approve payroll, adjust employee contracts, or review compliance risks, Remote’s dashboard consolidates everything into an organized and user-friendly platform, making it easier to oversee global operations efficiently.<br /><br /><b>Employment Contracts</b><br /><br />Remote simplifies the process of drafting and managing employment contracts, ensuring they comply with local labor laws and regulations in each country where you hire. With built-in legal expertise, Remote helps you create contracts that align with jurisdiction-specific requirements, reducing the risk of compliance issues and worker misclassification.<br /><br />Using customizable contract templates, you can quickly generate legally compliant agreements tailored to each employee’s location, job role, and benefits package. If you have your own contracts, you can upload them for legal review by Remote’s in-house experts to ensure they meet international standards.<br /><br />For companies hiring across multiple countries, Remote’s automated contract management saves time and effort by streamlining approvals, digital signatures, and document storage. You can also create bilingual contracts, making it easier to communicate terms clearly with international employees. By ensuring consistency, compliance, and ease of access, Remote’s contract management tools help businesses navigate the complexities of global hiring with confidence.<br /><br /><b>Local Legal Compliance and Advisory Services</b><br /><br />Remote provides comprehensive legal support, ensuring your business stays compliant with local labor laws and international employment regulations. Hiring in foreign markets comes with complex legal requirements, but Remote’s built-in compliance framework helps you navigate these challenges while significantly reducing legal risks.<br /><br />With Remote’s legal advisory services, you receive expert guidance on employment classification, tax obligations, benefits administration, and termination policies, ensuring every aspect of your workforce management aligns with local regulations. This minimizes the risk of misclassification penalties, non-compliance fines, and contractual disputes.<br /><br />The platform continuously monitors changes in employment laws across the countries it operates in, so you don’t have to keep up with evolving regulations manually. Whether you’re dealing with probation periods, severance requirements, or mandatory employee benefits, Remote ensures that your contracts, payroll, and HR processes remain legally sound and up to date.<br /><br />For businesses expanding internationally, Remote’s local legal expertise and proactive compliance measures provide peace of mind, allowing you to focus on scaling your workforce without unnecessary legal concerns.<br /><br /><b>Customizable Total Rewards</b><br /><br />Remote enables businesses to offer tailored benefits packages that align with local market expectations and employment regulations in each country. With its Customizable Total Rewards feature, you can enhance employee experience by providing competitive, region-specific compensation and perks, helping you attract and retain top talent globally.<br /><br />Rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all approach, Remote allows you to customize salary structures, bonuses, equity compensation, health benefits, and retirement plans based on local norms. This ensures that employees receive benefits that are both valuable and compliant with regional labor laws.<br /><br />Remote also simplifies benefits administration, ensuring that everything from healthcare contributions to paid leave policies is handled seamlessly. By offering country-specific rewards, you can maintain a consistent global benefits strategy while keeping employees engaged and satisfied, regardless of their location. Whether you're hiring in Europe, Asia, or the Americas, Remote helps you deliver a competitive, compliant, and attractive compensation package that meets the expectations of international employees.<br /><br /><b>Employee Onboarding</b><br /><br />Remote streamlines the onboarding process for international employees, making it faster, more efficient, and fully compliant with local regulations. With automated workflows, new hires can complete their onboarding quickly while ensuring that all necessary documentation, tax forms, and employment contracts are handled correctly from day one.<br /><br />The platform provides a guided onboarding experience, walking employees through contract signing, benefits enrollment, tax form submissions, and identity verification. HR teams can also customize onboarding steps, including setting probation periods, salary structures, and role-specific requirements.<br /><br />By automating administrative tasks, Remote reduces the burden on HR teams and ensures compliance with local labor laws. Employees receive self-service access to important documents and benefits information through Remote’s platform, eliminating unnecessary delays and confusion.<br /><br />With Remote’s fast and structured onboarding system, companies can seamlessly integrate international hires, providing a smooth and professional experience that helps employees settle into their new roles quickly. This efficiency not only improves employee satisfaction but also ensures businesses remain compliant in every country they operate in.<br /><br /><b>Fair Price Guarantee</b><br /><br />Remote’s Fair Price Guarantee ensures transparent, predictable pricing with no minimums, hidden fees, or large upfront deposits. Unlike some global payroll and employment services that require costly commitments, Remote offers straightforward pricing so businesses can scale their workforce with confidence.<br /><br />One of the standout aspects of this guarantee is Remote’s 90-day satisfaction policy. If you’re not completely satisfied within the first three months, Remote will refund all management fees, allowing you to try their services with minimal risk.<br /><br />This commitment to fair pricing makes Remote an attractive option for businesses of all sizes, ensuring that you pay only for the services you need—without unexpected costs or long-term financial obligations. Whether you're hiring a single international employee or building a distributed team, Remote provides cost-effective, transparent workforce management solutions that support your global expansion.<br /><br /><br /><b>IS IT SAFE TO USE? </b><br /><br />Yes, Remote is a highly secure platform designed to protect your company’s sensitive information while ensuring compliance with global data protection standards. Security is a top priority when managing international payroll and employee records, and Remote takes extensive measures to safeguard your data.<br /><br />All information transmitted through Remote is encrypted end-to-end, ensuring payroll details, employee contracts, and banking information remain secure. The platform complies with international data protection laws such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), so you can trust that your company is meeting privacy regulations no matter where you operate. Remote also helps businesses stay compliant with local labor laws and tax regulations, reducing risks related to worker misclassification or non-compliant contracts.<br /><br />To prevent fraud and unauthorized access, Remote uses multi-factor authentication (MFA) and identity verification for all users. Its payroll processing follows strict security protocols, utilizing secure banking channels to ensure timely and compliant salary payments worldwide. Additionally, Remote conducts regular security audits and penetration testing to proactively address potential vulnerabilities.<br /><br />The platform also provides role-based access controls (RBAC), allowing you to manage who can view or edit sensitive payroll and HR data. This ensures that only authorized personnel have access, reducing the risk of internal security breaches. In case of system failures or cyberattacks, Remote maintains secure cloud backups, ensuring your data is protected and easily recoverable.<br /><br />Overall, Remote offers enterprise-grade security and strict compliance protocols, making it a reliable choice for businesses managing a global workforce. With its advanced encryption, fraud prevention measures, and regulatory compliance, you can confidently handle payroll and HR operations without worrying about security risks.<br /><br /><br /><b>USER INTERFACE</b><br /><br />Despite its robust feature set, Remote Payroll offers a clean, visually appealing interface.

This logical layout, supported by clear icons and text labels, ensures a smooth user experience.<br /><br />Beyond payroll management, you also get access to company-wide details, important documents, and an app marketplace for additional functionality. Remote currently integrates with BambooHR, Greenhouse, and other third-party tools, making it easy to connect your payroll system with HR and recruitment platforms.

To assist users, Remote provides a help center and support hub, offering guidance on payroll and HR-related tasks. However, some users feel that additional contact options would enhance the support experience.<br /><br />Currently, support is available only via email, which works for general inquiries but may not be ideal for urgent payroll or HR issues.
