I enjoy the different ways to sign and initial different documents that otherwise could not be sent back electronically without several steps. I also have created templates and forms for consistent reports and forms I will be using to help speed up my entries. Thank you!”</i><br /><br /><i>“In my field of work and opportunities, I quite often have to complete and sign agreements and contracts whenever and wherever. Utilizing a great format that is simply put- user friendly and fast, PDF Filler ensures that the people needing my consent or handling signed forms can be done in the moment. We live that way today so it is one of the most useful tools to do such. I am usually the "user" yet in a side hobby for other business work I get to seek the PDF Filler benefits from my outside sourced clients.”</i><br /><br /><i>“I use it for everything. Whenever I need to have a document emailed to me, which needs to be filled out and returned, I cannot be bothered to print it, fill it and then scan it back. PDF filler allows me to not have to travel with a printer or portable scanner. The phone apps that are supposed to work like scanners are abysmal. So, thanks to the PDF scanner I am able to travel with just a laptop and not bother with having to use the business centers at hotels.”</i><br /><br /><br /><b>WHO IS BEHIND PDFFILLER?</b><br /> <br />pdfFiller is a software company that provides online document management, editing, and e-signature solutions.
