Still, as long as you know what you're looking for, it's not that hard. <strong>Be wary about downloading some "cheap" and "free" antivirus brands</strong>, though, as many of these lesser-known brands are malware in disguise. Before you download anything, make sure that the software comes from a trustworthy and legitimate brand. </p><p>At its core, you'll want your antivirus program to offer protection against new and emerging forms of malware — not just viruses but also worms, Trojan horses, spyware, rootkits, and ransomware. <strong>All the antivirus brands on our top 10 list offer advanced protection against all these types of malware.</strong> Some are full-suite Internet security packages that also offers the following extras: </p><ul class="leftbullet"><li><strong>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</strong> — This is a software application designed to help you surf the web anonymously.</li><li><strong>Parental controls</strong> — It helps parents protect their children online by restricting what kind of content can be accessed. </li><li><strong>Password manager</strong> — Another app designed to create and store strong passwords in an encrypted vault.</li></ul><p>Having these extra security features along with the core features of your chosen antivirus will significantly improve the overall protection of your device's built-in security systems. And <strong>the more secure your device is, the less chance of you falling victim to cyber crimes like hacking, phishing scams, ransomware, website spoofing,</strong> and more. </p><p><strong>So, how can you choose the best antivirus brand for your device?</strong> No worries! We researched for you and spent dozens of hours reviewing and comparing the best antivirus programs available in the market today. We compared each brand's functions, like malware detection, security features, impact on system resources, value for money, and customer service.</p></div><div class="hl-box hl-box-purple mt-5"><h3><strong>An overview of the best Antivirus Software for 2025:</strong></h3><ul class="leftbullet"><li><strong>&#129351; 1. <a href="https://track.totalav.com/5ef0cd87795a6/click/lugchga49z21il2kyzpgw" title="TotalAV" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TotalAV</a> — </strong><strong>Trusted by 25 million users worldwide, TotalAV is our #1 choice for Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS.</strong> This full security suite offers real-time protection against viruses, malware, ransomware, adware, and more at a price that currently cannot be beaten!</li><li><strong>&#129352; 2. <a href="https://norton.ow5a.net/c/1956721/1640775/4405?subId1=lugchga49z21il2kyzpgw&amp;sharedid=lugchga49z21il2kyzpgw" title="Norton" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Norton</a> — </strong><strong>Excellent virus detection rates, advanced parental controls, and complete protection against all types of threats.</strong> </li><li><strong>&#129353; 3. <a href="https://www.pandasecurity.com/security-promotion/?campaign=dome2310&amp;productID=PDA&amp;track=191244&amp;option=yearly&amp;autobilling=no&amp;selector=1&amp;coupon=50OFFMULTIP&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=PAP&amp;utm_campaign=ACPD2310&amp;a_affid=ac217&amp;a_bnid=28292c55&amp;data1=lugchga49z21il2kyzpgw" title="Panda" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Panda</a> — </strong><strong>User-friendly.</strong> </li><li><a href="#comparison">Feature comparison of our top Antivirus Software recommendations for 2025.</a></li><li><a href="#faq">Frequently Asked Questions about Antivirus Software (FAQ).</a></li></ul></div><div class="mt-5"><h2>Top things to keep in mind before downloading antivirus software.</h2><p>On the lookout for the best antivirus program? Here are some important considerations before you pick which software to download. </p><ul class="leftbullet"><li><strong>Make a list of your must-have features.</strong> All antivirus programs are designed to protect your device against malware, and we made sure that all our recommendations excel in that department. What you'll need to focus on are those few extras that would meet specific needs. For example, if you have trouble remembering passwords, an antivirus with a password manager would benefit you. If you want online privacy and security, something with a VPN would be great. If you have kids who access the internet unsupervised, you'll probably want a security package with very good parental controls such as Norton 360.</li><li><strong>How many devices do you want to protect?</strong> Like most people, you probably have more than one device: a mobile phone, tablet, and laptop. If you need to cover a bunch of devices, look for a security suite that offers multiple licenses like TotalAV. </li><li><strong>Decide which device you want to protect.</strong> Not all antivirus programs work on every platform, so you need to make sure your chosen software is compatible with your device. Check the <a href="#faq">FAQ section below</a> to see which programs we recommend for each device. You also have to consider other factors, such as your device's current performance. If your device takes half an hour to boot, you need to find an antivirus program with low resource/CPU usage. For example, TotalAV is a lightweight option that won't hog resources and slow your computer down.</li><li><strong>Consider ease of use.</strong> Good antivirus software must be easy to use both by tech-savvy users and casual users with little to no knowledge about cybersecurity. Almost all of the top brands on this list offer a "no questions asked" money-back guarantee. Take advantage of this time to test the software and see which one you'll be most comfortable with. Ideally, it should run in the background and do its job without disrupting your activities. If you find anything that's not to your liking, contact customer support to get a refund. Then go and test another one until you hit gold.</li></ul></div><div class="mt-5"><strong><b>In this article, you will find our top recommendations based on our research.</b></strong></div><h2 id="review-1" class="mt-5">1. <a class="h6-title" href="https://track.totalav.com/5ef0cd87795a6/click/lugchga49z21il2kyzpgw" title="TotalAV" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TotalAV</a> — Best Overall Antivirus Package</h2><p><a href="https://track.totalav.com/5ef0cd87795a6/click/lugchga49z21il2kyzpgw" title="TotalAV" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid" src="../pics/article-totalav-v6.png" alt="totalav"></a></p><div><p>Founded only in 2016, you could say that TotalAV is still a new kid on the antivirus block.

Before we can make a recommendation, an antivirus product must meet these requirements:</p><ul class="leftbullet"><li id="step-1"><strong>Strong protection against all types of malware.</strong> We only endorse software that has a proven track record against the newest malware threats. Viruses are just one type of malware — Nowadays, your devices need protection against spyware, rootkits, ransomware, and anything else that could cause your device harm online.</li><li id="step-2"><strong>Minimum drag on system resources.</strong> Our top list only includes lightweight programs that don't slow down your computer (even if it's not the newest model).</li><li id="step-3"><strong>Easy and User-Friendly.</strong> Because everyone needs malware protection, our top recommendations are all easy to set up and use, no matter how tech-savvy.</li><li id="step-4"><strong>Packed with extra security features.</strong> The antivirus programs we recommend offer improvements to your device’s native security systems beyond protection against malware.</li><li id="step-5"><strong>Great value for money.</strong> Our top picks all have money-back guarantees, so you can try before you buy. They also offer packages for protecting numerous devices and a bunch of added features that make getting online protection a valuable investment indeed.</li></ul><div class="hl-box hl-box-red mt-5"><h3><strong>Popular Antivirus Brands That We're Not Mad About:</strong></h3><p>You may have noticed the glaring absence of some of the biggest names in the antivirus market. Please note that over 50 antivirus brands are available, and we strive to limit our lists to the best ones. Some of the household names didn't make the cut simply because they were not quite good enough to earn a spot on our top list, suffered a security breach, or may have been compromised in the past.</p><ul class="leftbullet"><li><strong>Kaspersky.</strong> Its antivirus engine is perfect. However, there have been allegations of them colluding with Russia's Federal Security Service. In fact, since 2017, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security banned Kaspersky products from all government departments. It's a massive blow to Kasperky's reputation, one that we simply cannot ignore. </li><li><strong>Avast &amp; AVG.</strong> Did you know that Mozilla, Opera, and Chrome marketplaces have removed Avast from their marketplaces since 2019? Avast was allegedly selling user data to large corporations for marketing purposes. At a time when online privacy has become a real issue, we cannot turn a blind eye to this major security blunder.</li><li><strong>ESET.</strong> It's highly-rated antivirus software, but one that we feel would be more suitable for corporations and businesses rather than family or individual users. They do have a home edition version, but it's not the easiest to use.</li></ul></div><h2 id="comparison" class="mt-5">Feature Comparison of the Top Antivirus Programs</h2><p><table class="table table-bordered table-responsive table-fish"><thead class="thead-light"><tr><th scope="col">Brand</th><th scope="col">Firewall</th><th scope="col">System Optimization</th><th scope="col">Password Manager</th><th scope="col">VPN</th><th scope="col">Real-time protection</th><th scope="col">Free Version</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong><a href="https://track.totalav.com/5ef0cd87795a6/click/lugchga49z21il2kyzpgw" title="TotalAV" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TotalAV</a></strong></td><td>&#10004;</td><td>&#10004;</td><td>&#10004;</td><td>&#10004;</td><td>&#10004;</td><td>&#10004;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://norton.ow5a.net/c/1956721/1640775/4405?subId1=lugchga49z21il2kyzpgw&amp;sharedid=lugchga49z21il2kyzpgw" title="Norton" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Norton</a></strong></td><td>&#10004;</td><td>&#10004;</td><td>&#10004;</td><td>&#10004;</td><td>&#10004;</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a href="https://www.pandasecurity.com/security-promotion/?campaign=dome2310&amp;productID=PDA&amp;track=191244&amp;option=yearly&amp;autobilling=no&amp;selector=1&amp;coupon=50OFFMULTIP&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=PAP&amp;utm_campaign=ACPD2310&amp;a_affid=ac217&amp;a_bnid=28292c55&amp;data1=lugchga49z21il2kyzpgw" title="Panda" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Panda</a></strong></td><td>&#10004;</td><td>-</td><td>&#10004;</td><td>&#10004;</td><td>&#10004;</td><td>-</td></tr></tbody></table></p><div class="hl-box hl-box-green mt-5"><h3 id="faq"><strong>Top Antivirus Programs - Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h3><ul class="leftbullet"><li><strong><a href="#faq-1"> What is the best antivirus for Windows users?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#faq-2"> What is the best antivirus for Apple / Mac users?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#faq-3"> What is the best antivirus for Android smartphones?</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#faq-4"> What is the best antivirus app for iPhone users?</a></strong></li></ul></div><h3 id="faq-1" class="mt-4">&#127942; What is the best antivirus for Windows users?</h3><p>Brands in our top 10 recommendations are compatible with both the latest and older versions of Windows - from Windows 7 to Windows 10.

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a hurry? Here is the top antivirus program: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;leftbullet&quot;&gt;	&lt;li&gt;	&lt;strong&gt;TotalAV:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Complete digital home protection with loads of extras such as VPN, firewall, password manager, device tuneup, and personal firewall at an unbeatable price. &lt;/span&gt;	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/v/1&quot; title=&quot;TotalAV&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get the best protection of 2021 here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#TotalAV&quot;&gt;Read more about TotalAV here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With dozens of antivirus programs in the market today, &lt;strong&gt;choosing the best protection that falls within your budget might be a tall order.&lt;/strong&gt; Sure, it can be a tad overwhelming, wading through all the information and technical jargon. Still, as long as you know what you&#039;re looking for, it&#039;s not that hard. &lt;strong&gt;Be wary about downloading some &quot;cheap&quot; and &quot;free&quot; antivirus brands&lt;/strong&gt;, though, as many of these lesser-known brands are malware in disguise. Before you download anything, make sure that the software comes from a trustworthy and legitimate brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, you&#039;ll want your antivirus program to offer protection against new and emerging forms of malware &mdash; not just viruses but also worms, Trojan horses, spyware, rootkits, and ransomware. &lt;strong&gt;All the antivirus brands on our top 10 list offer advanced protection against all these types of malware.&lt;/strong&gt; Some are full-suite Internet security packages that also offers the following extras: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;leftbullet&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtual Private Network (VPN)&lt;/strong&gt; &mdash; This is a software application that hides your IP address so you can surf the web anonymously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parental controls&lt;/strong&gt; &mdash; It helps parents protect their children online by restricting what kind of content can be accessed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Password manager&lt;/strong&gt; &mdash; Another app designed to create and store strong passwords in an encrypted vault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having these extra security features along with the core features of your chosen antivirus will significantly improve the overall protection of your device&#039;s built-in security systems. And &lt;strong&gt;the more secure your device is, the less chance of you falling victim to cyber crimes like hacking, phishing scams, ransomware, website spoofing,&lt;/strong&gt; and more.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An overview of the best antivirus programs for 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;leftbullet&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;/v/1&quot; title=&quot;TotalAV&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TotalAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&mdash; Trusted by 25 million users worldwide, TotalAV is our #1 choice for Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS.&lt;/strong&gt;This full security suite offers real-time protection against antiviruses, malware, ransomware, adware, and more at a price that currently cannot be beaten!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. &lt;a href=&quot;/v/2&quot; title=&quot;Norton&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Norton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&mdash; Excellent virus detection rates, advanced parental controls, and complete protection against all types of threats. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. &lt;a href=&quot;/v/7&quot; title=&quot;Bitdefender&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bitdefender&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&mdash; Exceptional virus and spyware protection, top-rated full security suite. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. &lt;a href=&quot;/v/13&quot; title=&quot;Intego&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Intego&lt;/a&gt; &mdash; Best antivirus for Mac users, &lt;/strong&gt;but this award-winning antivirus is now also available for Windows!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. &lt;a href=&quot;/v/5&quot; title=&quot;Panda&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Panda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &mdash; Great value-for-money security package, excellent protection for Windows PC and Android.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#PC Protect&quot;&gt;Plus two more runner-up antivirus programs to check out.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#faq&quot;&gt;FAQ about antivirus programs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;TotalAV&quot; class=&quot;mt-5&quot;&gt;1. &lt;a class=&quot;h6-title&quot; href=&quot;/v/1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TotalAV&lt;/a&gt; &mdash; Best Overall Antivirus Package
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/v/1&quot; title=&quot;Total AV&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;/pics/article-totalav-v6.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded only in 2016, you could say that TotalAV is still a new kid on the antivirus block. Experts, however, have long set their eyes on this new player for its &lt;strong&gt;advanced malware protection, helpful security features, and unbeatable value for money.&lt;/strong&gt; After our comprehensive review, we can say without any doubt that TotalAV is a fantastic choice. Despite being a relatively new brand, &lt;strong&gt;it utilizes the white label version of Avira&#039;s core antivirus technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Therefore, you can trust that it runs on one of the most trusted cybersecurity technology available today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than its price tag, we particularly love TotalAV because it is easy to use and navigate. Everything looks and feels right, with all the features working seamlessly in the background so you can focus on other things. Unless you&#039;re a tech wizard looking for more advanced features, &lt;strong&gt;you will love TotalAV&#039;s straightforward functionality and simple interface.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TotalAV also ticks all the right boxes when it comes to security features, which seems to include everything but the kitchen sink. For example, &lt;strong&gt;it offers safe browsing VPN, password manager, ransomware protection, firewall protection, disc cleaner, and advanced phishing protection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its &lt;strong&gt;powerful antivirus engine, superb malware detection, and incredibly easy-to-use interface,&lt;/strong&gt; TotalAV is an excellent antivirus solution for all your devices.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;Norton&quot; class=&quot;mt-5&quot;&gt;2. &lt;a class=&quot;h6-title&quot; href=&quot;/v/2&quot; title=&quot;Norton&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Norton&lt;/a&gt; &mdash; Best Antivirus Software For Families&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/v/2&quot; title=&quot;Norton&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/pics/article-norton-v10.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norton has been around since 1990 so, it&#039;s pretty much a household name at this point. &lt;strong&gt;Winning PCMag.com&#039;s Editor&#039;s Choice award 39 times, Norton&#039;s parental control feature is second to none.&lt;/strong&gt; It&#039;s not exactly the cheapest option out there. Still, you get your money&#039;s worth with features like a smart firewall, password manager, cloud storage, and protection against spyware, malware, viruses, and malware. And that&#039;s just the basic plan. Splurge a bit more, and you get the whole shebang with features like parental controls, &lt;strong&gt;virus removal service, and SafeCam - a functionality that can detect and block unauthorized access to your PC webcam.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norton is so confident in their antivirus and malware protection that they offer &lt;strong&gt;Virus Protection Promise&lt;/strong&gt; on all their plans. It&#039;s essentially a virus removal guarantee. If you encounter any virus-related problem during your active subscription, you&#039;ll have access to the services of a Norton expert. In the unlikely event that they were unable to remove the virus from your devices, you get your money back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;re always on your phone like most of us these days, Norton antivirus can help protect mobile traffic. The program is compatible with all operational systems and can protect up to 10 devices: PC, Mac, smartphones, and tablets. Just choose your desired plan and download the app on your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norton is a fantastic product with extensive features, intuitive navigation design, and multiple customer service options &mdash; all at a relatively affordable price.&lt;/strong&gt; It does exactly what it says on the tin without unnecessary bells and whistles. It&#039;s honestly one of the best antivirus programs we can recommend for your entire household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center pt-3 pb-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;btn btn-danger btn-custom jumpy&quot; href=&quot;/v/2&quot; title=&quot;Norton 360&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get NORTON - Protect Your Devices!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Intego&quot; class=&quot;mt-5&quot;&gt;3. &lt;a class=&quot;h6-title&quot; href=&quot;/v/13&quot; title=&quot;Intego&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Intego&lt;/a&gt; &mdash; Security Suite For Mac (and now also Windows)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/v/13&quot; title=&quot;Intego&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/pics/article-intego-v9.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intego has been exclusively protecting Mac since 1997.&lt;/strong&gt; Recently they have also added a Windows version. They promise to protect your data and privacy, optimize your Mac or PC, and keep your children safe online, and that&#039;s exactly what they do. With this software, &lt;strong&gt;you get real-time protection against malware, adware, spyware, ransomware, and other threats. There are also some nice extras like parental control filtering, a cleanup tool, and Mac backup options. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intego has a long list of certifications and awards from the independent research organization, AV-Test, including a perfect score for their antivirus scanner. &lt;strong&gt;We like how superfast it is, lightweight, discreet, and reliable.&lt;/strong&gt; Although many people think that Macs don&#039;t get viruses, that is not the case. Maybe it&#039;s less vulnerable than Windows PC, but your device can still get infected with malware. &lt;strong&gt;Intego is a great addition to your Mac or PC security experience and will provide the necessary protection against phishing attacks, ransomware, hackers, and other nasties.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intego offers a fab range of security features, and its superb protection against Zero-Day attacks makes it a top choice for Mac &amp; PC users.&lt;/strong&gt; Since it&#039;s focused on the Mac OS, you can be sure that it will protect you against macOS malware that other antivirus software often miss. What&#039;s more, the dedication clearly shows in terms of design, improvements on existing security measures, and device optimization tools. Do you know what the best part is?

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center pt-3 pb-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;btn btn-danger btn-custom jumpy&quot; href=&quot;/v/13&quot; title=&quot;Intego&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get INTEGO - Protect Your Mac!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Bitdefender&quot; class=&quot;mt-5&quot;&gt;4. &lt;a class=&quot;h6-title&quot; href=&quot;/v/7&quot; title=&quot;Bitdefender&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bitdefender&lt;/a&gt; &mdash; Excellent Choice for Advanced Users
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/v/7&quot; title=&quot;Bitdefender&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/pics/article-bitdefender-v7.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its founding in 2001, Bitdefender has been steadily rising in ranks and now boasts of over half a billion users, supplying antivirus software to government organizations, small, mid-size, and enterprises businesses, as well as private individuals. They&#039;ve been consistent in acing several awards categories, including Real-World Protection, Malware Protection, False Alarms, Best Repair, Performance, and more. Bitdefender won &lt;strong&gt;Best of the Year 2020&lt;/strong&gt; by PCMag and Product of the Year by AV-Comparatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitdefender has a polished and professional interface with plenty of amazing features such as real-time antivirus protection, firewall, microphone monitor, VPN, webcam protection, file encryption, and much more.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there&#039;s any downside, it&#039;s that Bitdefender is not the most straightforward security suite to use. Installation and setup took a while to finish. While it is indeed powerful, it might prove cumbersome to some technophobes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitdefender provides exceptional anti-phishing protection, but it comes at a price. It&#039;s not exactly the cheapest security suite around, nor is it the easiest to use. The menu is slightly complicated, so non-tech savvy users should probably check out either Norton or TechAV as both are relatively easier to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center pt-3 pb-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;btn btn-danger btn-custom jumpy&quot; href=&quot;/v/7&quot; title=&quot;Bitdefender&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get BITDEFENDER - Protect Your Devices!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Panda&quot; class=&quot;mt-5&quot;&gt;5. &lt;a class=&quot;h6-title&quot; href=&quot;/v/5&quot; title=&quot;Panda&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Panda&lt;/a&gt; &mdash; Advanced Machine Learning Antivirus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/v/5&quot; title=&quot;Panda&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/pics/article-panda-v7.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its founding 30 years ago, Panda Security has racked up numerous awards, including multiple Real-World Protection tests from AV-Comparatives, ITPro Editor&#039;s Choice, Computing Security Excellence Awards, PC Editor&#039;s Choice more. &lt;strong&gt;Panda offers cutting-edge technologies across its numerous offerings, making it ideal for any budget. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boasting artificial intelligence and cloud computing, Panda Security guarantees high-level protection at a minimal footprint. &lt;strong&gt;We love that you get real-time anti-virus protection, firewall, password and personal data protection, ransomware manager, remote device control, external device scanner, and even a VPN!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take note that there is quite a significant difference in price between the most basic and top-tier packages. I would go with either the Panda Dome Advanced or Panda Dome Complete for parental controls, identity protection, password generator, and protection against advanced threats and cyberattacks. &lt;strong&gt;All plans come with a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can try it risk-free and get a refund if it&#039;s not right for you. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panda Security may not be as popular as brands like Norton and TotalAV, but they&#039;re offering leading-edge security features at an attractive price point. If you don&#039;t really need any advanced features, their Essential plan should do just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center pt-3 pb-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;btn btn-danger btn-custom jumpy&quot; href=&quot;/v/5&quot; title=&quot;Panda&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get PANDA - Protect Your Devices!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;PC Protect&quot; class=&quot;mt-5&quot;&gt;6. &lt;a class=&quot;h6-title&quot; href=&quot;/v/38&quot; title=&quot;PC Protect&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PC Protect&lt;/a&gt; &mdash; Best Value Security Package
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/v/38&quot; title=&quot;PC Protect&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/pics/article-pcprotect-v7.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have covered previously, PC Protect runs on the award-winning Avira antivirus engine - giving you the best in terms of security at a price that is hard to beat. PC Protect provides almost all security functions you could ever want from antivirus software: protection against malware, virus, and spyware, adware removal, system tune-up, advanced firewall, ad blocker, and QuickScan or Full System Scan. You&#039;ll be able to &lt;strong&gt;browse in private, block intrusive ads, stop malicious scams, clear tracking cookies, and block any attempts to steal your personal information.&lt;/strong&gt; What&#039;s more, PC Protect is available across multiple devices, so you&#039;ll be protected at home and on the go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users also seem to love this software. As of July 2021, they have a solid 4.3 rating out of 5 on TrustPilot with over 1,300 reviews. They love how PC Protect quietly runs in the background and does not slow their computer down, unlike other antivirus programs. Thanks mainly to &lt;strong&gt;System Boost, a feature that helps your computer run faster and more efficiently.&lt;/strong&gt; It uninstalls or stops unnecessary programs and processes, cleans up files, and ensures that your machine runs at its optimal performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PC Protect offers all the essentials at an incredible price and without hogging system resources.&lt;/strong&gt; You get system tune-up and optimization tools, browser cleaner and manager, 24/7 technical support, and more. If you&#039;re looking for a full-security suite without breaking the bank, you can&#039;t go wrong with PC Protect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center pt-3 pb-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;btn btn-danger btn-custom jumpy&quot; href=&quot;/v/38&quot; title=&quot;PC Protect&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get PC PROTECT - Protect Your Devices!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;BullGuard&quot; class=&quot;mt-5&quot;&gt;Bonus. &lt;a class=&quot;h6-title&quot; href=&quot;/v/6&quot; title=&quot;BullGuard&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BullGuard&lt;/a&gt; &mdash; Best for Gamers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/v/6&quot; title=&quot;BullGuard&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/pics/article-billguard-v11.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UK-Based BullGuard is a software company that has been consistently winning prizes from independent testing labs for their antivirus packages. The Danish brand recently won the 2020 Stevie American Business Award&reg; in the Business Technology - Endpoint Security Management Solution category. In particular, judges noted the brand&#039;s &lt;strong&gt;superior anti-malware protection, machine learning for advanced zero-day threat detection, real-time scanning and on-demand scanning, safe browsing, anti-theft components, and comprehensive endpoint security for multiple devices.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For individual users, you&#039;ll be happy with their multi-layered protection, online identity protection, home network scanner, parental control, firewall, and secure payments. One standout component which you won&#039;t find in any other antivirus program is &lt;strong&gt;BullGuard&#039;s Game Booster&lt;/strong&gt;, a feature that protects gamers without interfering or slowing their gameplay. It &lt;strong&gt;frees up system resources for a smoother gaming experience and blocks pop-up ads and other annoyances that could interrupt your gaming session.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you&#039;re an avid gamer, BullGuard should be your number one choice of antivirus software.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if you haven&#039;t played a game in your life, there&#039;s still a lot to like about it, starting with its powerful machine learning antivirus technology. Parental control and online identity protection are some of the nice features you can have at a reasonable price. If you&#039;re still not sure, you can take advantage of their 30-day free trial, so you can try it first before committing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center pt-3 pb-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;btn btn-danger btn-custom jumpy&quot; href=&quot;/v/6&quot; title=&quot;BullGuard&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get BULLGUARD - Protect Your Devices!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We analyzed more than 20 different security products&lt;/strong&gt; and have therefore developed extremely high expectations when it comes to cybersecurity. Before we can make a recommendation, an antivirus product must meet these requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;leftbullet&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong protection against all types of malware.&lt;/strong&gt; We only endorse software that has a proven track record against the newest malware threats. Viruses are just one type of malware &mdash; Nowadays, your devices need protection against spyware, rootkits, ransomware, and anything else that could cause your device harm online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimum drag on system resources.&lt;/strong&gt; Our top list only includes lightweight programs that don&#039;t slow down your computer (even if it&#039;s not the newest model).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy and User-Friendly.&lt;/strong&gt; Because everyone needs malware protection, our top recommendations are all easy to set up and use, no matter how tech-savvy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packed with extra security features.&lt;/strong&gt; The antivirus programs we recommend offer improvements to your device&rsquo;s native security systems beyond protection against malware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great value for money.&lt;/strong&gt; Our top picks all have money-back guarantees, so you can try before you buy. They also offer packages for protecting numerous devices and a bunch of added features that make getting online protection a valuable investment indeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hl-box hl-box-red&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Popular Antivirus Brands That We&#039;re Not Mad About:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed the glaring absence of some of the biggest names in the antivirus market. Please note that over 50 antivirus brands are available, and we strive to limit our lists to the best ones. Some of the household names didn&#039;t make the cut simply because they were not quite good enough to earn a spot on our top list, suffered a security breach, or may have been compromised in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;leftbullet&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kaspersky.&lt;/strong&gt; Its antivirus engine is perfect. However, there have been allegations of them colluding with Russia&#039;s Federal Security Service. In fact, since 2017, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security banned Kaspersky products from all government departments. It&#039;s a massive blow to Kasperky&#039;s reputation, one that we simply cannot ignore. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avast &amp; AVG.&lt;/strong&gt; Did you know that Mozilla, Opera, and Chrome marketplaces have removed Avast from their marketplaces since 2019? Avast was allegedly selling user data to large corporations for marketing purposes. At a time when online privacy has become a real issue, we cannot turn a blind eye to this major security blunder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ESET.&lt;/strong&gt; It&#039;s highly-rated antivirus software, but one that we feel would be more suitable for corporations and businesses rather than family or individual users. They do have a home edition version, but it&#039;s not the easiest to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;hl-box hl-box-green&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;faq&quot;&gt;Top Antivirus Programs - Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;leftbullet&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#antivirus%20windows&quot;&gt;What is the best antivirus for Windows users?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#antivirus%20mac&quot;&gt;What is the best antivirus for Apple / Mac users?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#antivirus%20android&quot;&gt;What is the best antivirus for android smartphones?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#antivirus%20iphone&quot;&gt;What is the best antivirus app for iPhone users?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#antivirus%20for%20me&quot;&gt;What are the main things to note before downloading antivirus software?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;antivirus windows&quot; class=&quot;mt-5&quot;&gt;&amp;#127942; What is the best antivirus for Windows users?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brands in our top 10 recommendations are compatible with both the latest and older versions of Windows - from Windows 7 to Windows 10. If you&#039;re looking for a FREE antivirus program, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#TotalAV&quot;&gt;TotalAV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is hard to beat. If you can afford a paid service,&lt;a href=&quot;#Norton&quot;&gt; Norton&lt;/a&gt; would be our best pick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;antivirus mac&quot; class=&quot;mt-5&quot;&gt;&amp;#127822; What is the best antivirus for Apple / Mac users?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the top recommendations on our list above work on all operating systems, including Apple or Mac.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Intego&quot;&gt; Intego&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; would be our number one choice as it is designed exclusively for Apple products. Another good recommendation is &lt;a href=&quot;/v/2&quot; title=&quot;Norton&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Norton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Check out our top list of the Best Mac Antivirus Software 2021 for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;antivirus android&quot; class=&quot;mt-5&quot;&gt;&amp;#128242; What is the best antivirus for android smartphones?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our favorite antivirus app for android devices is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Norton&quot;&gt;Norton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Depending on the package you choose, you can have 3, 5, or 10 licenses so you can protect all your family&#039;s devices. Norton also has a fantastic track record when it comes to job scanning and protecting against malicious apps. The only issue with Norton is that they are not the cheapest AV engine out there. For bargain hunters, an incredible choice is the &lt;a href=&quot;/v/1?o=mobile&quot; title=&quot;Mobile Antivirus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TotalAV app&lt;/a&gt; for Android.&lt;/strong&gt; Although it is not free like their desktop software, at only $2.95, it&#039;s a real bargain!
&lt;h3 id=&quot;antivirus iphone&quot; class=&quot;mt-5&quot;&gt;&amp;#128241; What is the best antivirus app for iPhone users?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Apple&#039;s iOS is considered more secure than Android, it would be a mistake to think that it&#039;s 100% hacker-proof. Sure, it&#039;s more difficult to hack than an Android device, but not impossible. We still recommend getting a decent antivirus app to protect your phone from phishing scams and data theft, as well as have peace of mind while banking, shopping, or just browsing the web. For iPhone users, we would recommend either &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Norton&quot;&gt;Norton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Bitdefender&quot;&gt;Bitdefender&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;review-0&quot;&gt;Top things to keep in mind before downloading antivirus software.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the lookout for the best antivirus program? Here are some important considerations before you pick which software to download. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;leftbullet&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a list of your must-have features.&lt;/strong&gt; All antivirus programs are designed to protect your device against malware, and we made sure that all our recommendations excel in that department. What you&#039;ll need to focus on are those few extras that would meet specific needs. For example, if you have trouble remembering passwords, an antivirus with a password manager would benefit you. If you are in the habit of downloading torrents, something with a VPN would be great. If you have kids who access the internet unsupervised, you&#039;ll probably want a security package with very good parental controls such as &lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#Norton&quot;&gt;Norton 360.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many devices do you want to protect?&lt;/strong&gt; Like most people, you probably have more than one device: a mobile phone, tablet, and laptop. If you need to cover a bunch of devices, look for a security suite that offers multiple licenses like &lt;a href=&quot;#TotalAV&quot;&gt;TotalAV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decide which device you want to protect.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all antivirus programs work on every platform, so you need to make sure your chosen software is compatible with your device. Check the &lt;a href=&quot;#faq&quot;&gt;FAQ section above&lt;/a&gt; to see which programs we recommend for each device. You also have to consider other factors, such as your device&#039;s current performance. If your device takes half an hour to boot, you need to find an antivirus program with low resource/CPU usage. For example, TotalAV is a lightweight option that won&#039;t hog resources and slow your computer down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider ease of use.&lt;/strong&gt; Good antivirus software must be easy to use both by tech-savvy users and casual users with little to no knowledge about cybersecurity. Almost all of the top brands on this list offer a &quot;no questions asked&quot; money-back guarantee. Take advantage of this time to test the software and see which one you&#039;ll be most comfortable with. Ideally, it should run in the background and do its job without disrupting your activities. If you find anything that&#039;s not to your liking, contact customer support to get a refund. Then go and test another one until you hit gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
