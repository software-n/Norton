Thus allowing me to get on and use both my laptop and mobile as tools for the job without distraction as to how and what it is doing. Previous security providers result in daily interruptions and updates. Bitdefender customer service is outstanding. I had picked up a malware issue on my mobile prior to loading Bitdefender, and with their support, the issue was corrected in a helpful and understanding manner.”</i><br /><br /><i>“Been using Bitdefender Total protection and the VPN for a couple of years. Easy to install with no noticeable degradation of system performance. A nice touch is the Bitdefender Central portal which helps you keep tabs on all your devices that have Bitdefender installed. Easy to configure and essentially forget. Updates can be set from hourly in increments up to 24 hours and all but feature updates install “silently” to minimize disruption. A great product at a very fair price.”</i><br /><br /><i>“I was having glitches and issues with VPN, so I emailed Bitdefender and received a response with very clear directions on how to solve the issue. Their communication back to me was not only clear but you could tell that they care about educating their customers on how to solve and understand issues. Very impressive Customer Care at Bitdefender.”</i><br /><br /><i>“I always panic a bit and become anxious when I think my computer has a virus. Bitdefender has always kept my computer quite safe. I have only needed to contact Bitdefender one time, and within 1 hour of contact, Alberto M. responded, solved my problem, and then they patiently taught me what the issue was, and further taught me how to resolve it myself and how to prevent it from happening in the future. THIS is magnificent customer service. Thank you!”</i><br /><br /><br /><b>WHO IS BEHIND BITDEFENDER?</b><br /><br />Bitdefender is a Romanian cybersecurity and anti-virus software company, founded in 2001 by Florin Talpes.

These features can be divided into three categories: Protection, Privacy, and Performance. Let’s go through all the features under the Protection category first: <br /><br /><div class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../../images/bitdefenderreview4.png"></div><br /><b>Protection:</b><br /><br /><strong><li>Safe Files</strong>- This is your first and best defense against ransomware attacks. Ransomware is a type of malware that can encrypt your file and hold it "hostage" until you pay for decryption. Safe Files prevents this situation by alerting you and blocking unauthorized access and modifications of your files, apps, and folders, including your photos, videos, documents, and more.<br /> <br /><strong><li>Network Threat Prevention</strong>- This new cyber threat intelligence technology can analyze and find suspicious network-level activities, as well as block sophisticated exploits, URLs related to malware and botnets, and brute force attacks. <br /><br /><strong><li>Advanced Threat Defense</strong>- Bitdefender closely monitors running apps using a method known as behavioral detection. It immediately takes action to stop infections the moment it notices anything suspicious. <br /><br /><strong><li>Multi-Layer Ransomware Protection</strong>- When it comes to protecting your data from ransomware, Bitdefender's multi-layered approach includes a data-protection layer that keeps your files safe no matter the type of attack. This includes your photos, videos, personal and work documents, music, and other data files. By integrating with Advanced Threat Defense, it helps prevent ransomware from encrypting your most crucial data. <br /><br /><strong><li>Vulnerability Assessment</strong>- This feature identifies and alerts you to vulnerabilities in your system that could be exploited by hackers, and helps you to fix them. <br /><br /><strong><li>Firewall</strong>- The firewall lets you keep an eye on the connections your apps make and set different rules for each one. You can choose, for example, what kind of network (home or public) they can connect to, what kind of protocol they can use, and whether they can make inbound or outbound connections (or both). And if that wasn't enough, you can also set up your own IPs and Ports. Last, you can turn on or off protection against port scans and stealth mode. <br /><br /><strong><li>Web Attack Prevention</strong>- This ensures that you never visit a malicious website. Before clicking on a link, you should determine whether your search results are secure. Additionally, Bitdefender helps block known infected links. <br /><br /><strong><li>Anti-Phishing</strong>- There are more and more online scams, but Bitdefender's advanced anti-phishing protection keeps you safe. This feature looks for websites that pretend to be safe in order to steal financial information like passwords or credit card numbers. If it finds one, it blocks it. <br /><br /><strong><li>Anti-Fraud</strong>- Bitdefender's cutting-edge filtering technology detects and alerts you to fraudulent websites. <br /><br /><strong><li>Rescue Environment</strong>- Allows you to restart your computer within a specialized Rescue Environment to scan and remove advanced malware that cannot be removed while the operating system is running. <br /><br /><strong><li>Antispam</strong>- Uses a combination of whitelist-blacklist, heuristic filter, and Bayesian learning module to keep your inbox spam-free. Bitdefender's anti-spam features work with any mailbox, including Outlook, Outlook Express, and Thunderbird. <br /><br /><br /><b>ARE THERE ADDITIONAL FEATURES?</b><br /><br />Here’s all the additional features you will get under the Performance and Privacy categories: <br /><br /><b>Performance:</b> <br /><br /><div class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../../images/bitdefenderreview7.png"></div><br /><strong><li>Autopilot Mode</strong> - This feature uses advanced algorithms to automatically optimize your device's security settings, without the need for user input. <br /><br /><strong><li>Adaptive security</strong> - This feature learns your habits and adjusts its settings accordingly, providing a more personalized security experience. <br /><br /><strong><li>Global Protective Network</strong> - Since most of the scanning is done in the cloud, there is minimal strain on your local system. This means that your computer's speed and performance are unaffected. Further, Bitdefender never scans the contents of your files and never uploads or stores them in the cloud, so you can rest assured that your information is always safe. <br /><br /><strong><li>Game, Movie and Work Modes</strong> - You can switch between game, movie, and work Modes if you purchase Bitdefender's Ultimate Security package. This function can tell when you're engaged in an activity like gaming, working, or watching a movie, so it won't bother you with requests during those times. Bitdefender temporarily disables pop-ups, optimizes display settings, and suspends insignificant background processes so you can get the most out of your device, no matter what you're doing on it. <br /><br /><strong><li>Battery Mode</strong> - This smart and useful feature saves battery life on laptops and tablets by temporarily changing settings like display, cooling, system updates, and Bluetooth. <br /><br /><div class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../../images/bitdefenderreview3.png"></div><br /><b>Privacy:</b> <br /><br /><strong><li>Parental Control</strong> - Bitdefender's parental control feature is an excellent tool for keeping track of your children's online activities and ensuring they are surfing the web safely.

Data usage caps of 200 MB per day are standard with most Bitdefender plans, leaving you with barely enough to use the internet. However, you can get unlimited data by upgrading to the Premium Security plan or purchasing it separately.<br /><br /><strong><li>Password Manager</strong> - This password manager is easy to use and has great features like multi-device sync, a password generator, advanced encryption, storage for an unlimited number of passwords, auto-save and auto-fill, and auditing of the password vault.

It also prevents advertisers from bombarding you with targeted ads, speeding up page loads and making your browsing experience more seamless. <br /><br /><div class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../../images/bitdefenderreview6.png"></div><br /><strong><li>Microphone Monitor</strong> - Monitors and finds out if a device's microphone is being used or accessed by someone who shouldn't be.

Consider which features you need and choose an antivirus that includes them.<br /><br /><strong>System requirements:</strong> Make sure that your system meets the minimum requirements for the antivirus you choose.<br /><br /><strong>Price:</strong> Consider the cost of the antivirus and whether it fits your budget.<br /><br /><strong>User-friendliness:</strong> The antivirus should be easy to use and navigate.<br /><br /><strong>Impact on system resources:</strong> The antivirus should have minimal impact on system resources, it should not slow down your computer or take up too much space on your hard drive.<br /><br /><strong>Reviews and ratings:</strong> Before making a final decision, it's always a good idea to read reviews and ratings of the antivirus to get a better understanding of how it performs and how satisfied other users are with it.<br /><br /><strong>Technical support:</strong> The antivirus should have a good level of technical support, this means that the company should offer help and assistance in case of any problem with the software.<br /><br /><br /><b>CUSTOMER SUPPORT</b> <br /><br />The company offers a wide range of support options, including a knowledge base, FAQs, a forum, email, phone, and live chat support.
